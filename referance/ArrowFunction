// normal function

const square = function(x){
    return x * x
}

// same function as arrow function

const square = (x) => {
    return x * x
}


// Can be shortened even further as it has only 1 line

const square = (x) => x * x


// A note on "this" binding.- Arrow functions bind "this" on the function it was created in as below example. Look at the foreach bit.

const event = {
    name: 'Birthday Pary',
    guestList:  ['Andrew','Jen','Mike'],
    printGuestList() {
        console.log('Guest list for ' + this.name)

        this.guestList.forEach((AnyVariable)=>{
            console.log(AnyVariable + ' is attending ' + this.name)
        })
    }
   
}

event.printGuestList()
