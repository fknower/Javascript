// the spread operator
//the spread operator concatinates an array 
//it looks the same as the rest operator


var ary1 = [4,5,6]
var ary2 = [1,2,3,...ary1]

console.log(ary2)

//result 1,2,3,4,5,6



// another use case is to copy an array

var ary1 = [4,5,6]
var ary2 = [...ary1]

console.log(ary2)

//result 4,5,6



// below shows a both rest and spread being used can be confusing
var meth = "twitter"
var opts = ["key","callbackurl"]

function login (method,...options){   // <--- rest operator
console.log(method)
console.log(options)
}

login(meth,...opts)          // <--- Spread operator
